**Thanks for using Ver 1.2 of DiscoMusic, an open source music bot**

New in this version:
**-) Added the /search command!**
The bot isn't playing the music that makes you vibe?
Now you can use the /search command to search for a list of songs and then
add your preferite to the queue!

**-) Added the /shuffle command!**

**-) Bug Fixes and enanchements**

**KNOWN BUGS**
**-)** Sometimes a track in the queue will not load and the bot will skip that song.
This is due to youtube responding with a HTTP 403 error.
If this happens, just reload the track, nothing I can do at the moment :/

Wanna help code the bot? Wanna help add new languages?
