# BasicDiscordMusicBot

Like the title says, it's a very basic Music Bot for Discord written in Python using:
pycord,
youtube_dl,
youtube_search,
discord_slash
and FFMpeg.

It supports audio sources from youtube and soundcloud.

# Installing the Bot
If you want to host the bot for yourselves, firstly use the command 
>pip3 install -r requirements.txt

This will install all the dependencies necessary for the bot to run.
After that, you need to create a tokenBot.txt file with your bot's token in it.
Now you are ready to execute the bot with
>python3 bot.py
