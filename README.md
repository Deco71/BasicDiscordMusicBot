# BasicDiscordMusicBot

Like the title says, it's a vary basic Music Bot for Discord written in Python using:
discord.py,
youtube_dl,
discord_slash
and FFMpeg.

It supports audio sources from youtube and soundcloud.

It'll be used for an Italian discord server, so all the embedded messagges will be in Italian,
but the code comments will be in english in the hope that someone find this code usefull as a basic
reference while writing your own personal music bot.
If you want, you are free to fork this code and do whatever you like, even use it as it is on your server.

Happy coding!
